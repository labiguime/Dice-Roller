# Dice-Roller
A dice roller application made following the teachings of the Developing Android Apps with Kotlin course on Udacity.

## Why make such a simple application?
Until now, I have been developing apps in Java but I feel like it's time to learn Kotlin. I decided that I would start from scratch and even though this is really simple it's a great starting point in my opinion.

## What does this application do?
As its name suggests, it simply rolls a dice when a button is pressed.
